- Developed U-Net and DeepLabV3+ models for road detection
-  Analyzed and prepared large datasets by resizing, normalization, and labeling to optimize model performance for road detection tasks.
-  Applied CRF post-processing to enhance segmentation accuracy and boundary precision, ensuring robust model per formance on real-world data.
-  The datasets were taken from IDD INSAAN website - https://idd.insaan.iiit.ac.in/
